#' ggcyclical extensions to ggplot2
#'
#' This manual page lists all the exported ggproto classes defined in 
#' `ggcyclical`, which were used to construct `stat_*` and `geom_*` functions.
#' These extend the `ggplot2` base functionality in accordance 
#' with its reference manual.
#' The `geom_*` functions provide new visualization marks. These are associated 
#' with underlying `stat_*` functions used for computation. Both are described 
#' in their own manual pages.
